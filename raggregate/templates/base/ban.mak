                Input duration as a timedelta constructor. It is fed directly to the timedelta factory so do not mess around here, you can break things seriously. <br />
                This functionality should never be exposed to a mortal because it can ruin your server. You haven't given the banhammer to anyone who hasn't earned it, have you?<br />
                If someone non-lazy comes around this could be made safe.<br />
